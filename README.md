# Sequence-ADT-using-Template
DATA STRUCT & ALGO

The Assignment

In this assignment, you are provided with 2 sets of supplied files (Assign04SuppliedFiles01 and Assign04SuppliedFiles02). They show two awkward/cumbersome/unwieldy/... ways to write a program that simultaneously uses 2 sequences of different item types (one being a sequence of real numbers and the other being a sequence of characters) and the 2 sequences are to behave in exactly the same way regardless of item type, using non-template classes for the sequence ADT where the item types are set with typedef. You should first study them to make sure that you understand the situation involved and the approaches used to tackle it. You are then to use the C++ template feature to construct a template class for the sequence ADT and use it to create a more compact/elegant/... version of the same program.
